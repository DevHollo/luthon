# Luthon: A Versatile Scripting Language with Pythonic Simplicity and Lua-like Extensibility

Luthon is an open-source programming language designed to offer the best of both worlds: the simplicity and readability of Python and the extensibility and embeddability of Lua. Its name, a fusion of "Lua" and "Python," reflects its inspiration from these two renowned languages.

## Key Features:

- **Pythonic Syntax:** Luthon's syntax closely resembles Python, making it approachable and readable for developers familiar with Python.

- **Lua-like Extensibility:** Inspired by Lua, Luthon is lightweight and perfect for extending applications, scripting game logic, or embedding in other software.

- **Compilation:** Unlike Python, which is interpreted, Luthon is compiled, providing performance benefits and the capability to create standalone executables.

- **Strong Typing:** Luthon supports strong typing, allowing explicit type declarations for variables, including `int`, `str`, and `bool`.

- **Built-in Packages:** Luthon includes a growing collection of built-in packages to simplify common tasks, facilitating rapid development.

- **String Interpolation:** Easily format strings with variable interpolation using `v"{...}"`.

- **Comments:** Luthon supports both single-line (`;;`) and multi-line (`;{}`) comments, enhancing code documentation.

## Use Cases:

- **Scripting:** Luthon excels in automating tasks, data manipulation, and application control through scripts.

- **Game Development:** With Lua-like extensibility, Luthon is ideal for scripting game logic and behaviors.

- **Extension:** Embed Luthon into other applications, enhancing their functionality with custom scripts.

- **General Programming:** Luthon's versatility suits a wide range of general-purpose programming tasks.

## Community and Development:

Luthon is a vibrant open-source project with an active community of developers and enthusiasts. Ongoing tasks include developing a compiler, building standard packages, creating setup utilities, and expanding its ecosystem.

## Get Started:

To start using Luthon, download the compiler or interpreter and explore its capabilities. Whether you're a Python enthusiast or Lua aficionado, Luthon offers a powerful yet straightforward scripting language for your projects.
